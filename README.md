# Noops Screensaver

![Noops Screensaver in Action](animation.gif)

This was a lunchtime hack to build something completely useless with [Hexbot](https://github.com/noops-challenge/hexbot), one of the [Noops Challenge bots](https://noopschallenge.com/).

Readers older than 30 may remember that old [DVD screensaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8NAlDOCG6g)? This is the Noops Screensaver built with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/). ~~Enjoy!!!~~
